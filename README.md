```
An AMPL license is required to run the project. A temporal LICENSE_KEY for limited usage is 
`570845f4-0a14-4e32-824f-7b66b06a66b0`.

## Replicating the results
In order to replicate the results the Jupyter Notebooks can be run. Note that the Linearly separable notebook includes a step with a long running time and can be skipped loading the results from a pickle file.
